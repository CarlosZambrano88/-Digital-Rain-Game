# -Digital-Rain-Game
Based of a concept known as "Digital Rain", this code will allow the user to click on trails to earn points. Trails go from top to bottom and increase in speed as the game progresses.

Features - Digital rain + mouse interaction + UI + lives & score
Challeneges - impementing mouse interaction with functions such as mouse.getpressed(); implementing images and text; and changing a variable real time in the UI
Outcomes - The ideal outcome of this is to have a game with a visible UI, functioning game, and functioning lives and score. The minimum viable outcome would be to have the game working. UI is important, but what's the point of having frosting if there is no cake?

Milestones: 4 weeks
Week 1 - complete digital rain and begin main game functionality
Week 2 - complete/finish game functionality
Week 3 - implement score and lives functionality
Week 4 - Add UI visuals to make it look nice
